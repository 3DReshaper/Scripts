# Pavement Inspection

This script provides a functionality to inspect pavement from a mesh and a central line in 3DReshaper.

To use it:
1. Import your mesh and the central line (as a polyline)
2. Open the script editor and load PavementInspection-CreateLines.js
3. Select the mesh and the central line and run the script like if you were running a 3DReshaper command. You will be required to enter the number of offset and the offset increment
4. Click a point on the side of the line where the offsets are needed
5. Repeat operations 3. and 4. on the other side if needed
6. Load PavementInspection-Evaluation-All.js
7. Select all the lines to be evaluated and run the script like if you were running a 3DReshaper command. You will be required to enter the length of the rule, the flatness tolerance and the increment
