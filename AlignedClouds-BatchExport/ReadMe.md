# AlignedClouds-BatchExport

The aim of this script is to export clouds which have been aligned and to export the matrix of each movement from measured to aligned cloud.

To use this script, modify the file path and the export format within the script, select the aligned clouds and launch the script. Note both clouds must have the same name and the corresponding suffix (import or export). At the end of the computation, the script will save the clouds in the chosen format and create a csv per matrix.
