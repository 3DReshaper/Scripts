# Line detection

This script provides a functionality to extract lines (catenary, electric line...) from a point cloud in 3DReshaper.

To use it, open the script editor and load LineDetection.js, import your cloud, select it and run the script like if you were running a 3DReshaper command. Then you just have to enter a sampling step for the resulting line and click a seed point in the line to extract.
