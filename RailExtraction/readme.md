# Rail detection

This script provides a functionality to extract rails from a point cloud in 3DReshaper.
To use it, open the script editor and load RailExtraction.js and run the script.

Note:
* This script is implemented so that it extracts the rails on a first point cloud and then looks for another point cloud file with incremented name in order to continue the extraction
* The extraction will continue until no file is found next
